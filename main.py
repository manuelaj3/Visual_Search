"""Made by Manuel Alc√°ntara Jurado

This code has the implementation of some Searching methods 
which are represented on a grid, selecting each method by
pressing on the keyboard the letter corresponding to each 
method.

The base of this code is copied from a Youtube video that
the teacher showed us about A* searching method, and based 
on it , I added the other methods.
